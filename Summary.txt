Project Summary

Project Title: Eco Eatery (or Eco Food Ordering Chatbot) - A simple but effective name that highlights the project's purpose.

Project Description: Eco Eatery is a user-friendly chatbot built with Dialogflow and FastAPI. It allows customers to place orders for food items from a virtual eatery, offering a seamless and conversational ordering experience. Users can add or remove items, track order status, and complete their orders via the chatbot. The system integrates with a MySQL database to store order details and track order statuses.

Key Features:
Chat-based Ordering: Natural language interaction for placing and managing orders.
Order Tracking: Provides real-time updates on order status.
Order Completion: Process orders, generate order IDs, and calculate total order costs.
Database Integration: Stores order data and statuses for future reference.
Web Interface: A simple HTML page provides a visual representation of the menu and a chatbot integration.

Technologies:
Dialogflow: Chatbot creation and natural language understanding.
FastAPI: High-performance web framework for handling API requests.
MySQL: Database for storing and retrieving order information.
HTML: Creating a basic website interface for the chatbot.

Benefits:
Enhanced Customer Experience: Provides a conversational ordering experience.
Improved Efficiency: Simplifies the ordering process, saving time for both customers and the eatery.
Order Management: Provides a clear way to track orders and their status.

Code Improvements:
Error Handling: Enhance error handling throughout the code. Implement more specific error messages in both the chatbot responses and the logs.
Database Schema: Ensure the database schema is designed to support future features, like user accounts and payment processing.
Data Validation: Add validation checks for user inputs (e.g., order quantities).
Code Structure: Consider using classes or modules to organize the code further, especially if the project grows in complexity.
Testing: Implement unit tests for core functions, particularly for the database interactions and order processing logic.
